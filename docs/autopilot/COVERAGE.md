# Coverage History

Coverage floors (brief §6.2, never lowered): backend ≥ 90% line / ≥ 80% branch;
auth, permissions, soft-delete, audit, and AI-agent modules ≥ 95% branch; frontend
≥ 80% line. `AGENTS.md`'s own bar (backend integration ≥ 90%, frontend unit ≥ 70%)
is looser than the brief's; the brief's floor governs per the source-of-truth
hierarchy (higher item wins — but note the brief is item 6, lowest-ranked, so
where `AGENTS.md` sets a *stricter* number than the brief, as it does for backend
line coverage — 90% either way here, no conflict — the stricter of the two always
applies; call out any future case where they actually diverge).

## Phase F — baseline (pre-milestone-work), 2026-09-16

Command: `cd backend && uv run pytest -q --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing`,
run inside the sandbox (WeasyPrint's native libraries are present here, unlike a
macOS host — see `CLAUDE.md`).

```
39 passed in 14.62s
TOTAL: 1032 stmts, 44 miss, 96% line coverage
```

No branch-coverage figure yet — `pytest-cov` was run without `--cov-branch`; add
it once `make check` exists (Phase F milestone F.2) so branch coverage is
tracked from the same baseline going forward.

| Module | Line % | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `permissions.py` | 100% | already meets the ≥95% floor for permission-critical modules |
| `audit_utils.py` | 100% | already meets the ≥95% floor |
| `timeline_utils.py` | 100% | |
| `routes_ai.py` | 100% | |
| `routes_auth.py` | 100% | |
| `routes_export.py` | 100% | |
| `routes_notifications.py` | 100% | |
| `schemas.py` | 98% | |
| `export_service.py` | 99% | |
| `routes_sharing.py` | 95% | |
| `auth.py` | 97% | auth-critical module; already at the ≥95% floor, keep it there as sessions/rotation/CSRF work lands in F.5 |
| `notification_service.py` | 97% | |
| `database.py` | 94% | |
| `main.py` | 93% | |
| `routes_timeline.py` | 94% | |
| `routes_opportunities.py` | 92% | |
| `time_utils.py` | 86% | `parse_timestamp` (lines 22-23) is unreferenced by any current caller |
| `ai_service.py` | 82% | the live `ask_openai` call itself and a couple of context-building edge branches are unexercised (mocked in tests by design, per brief §4.6) |

Frontend: no test runner exists yet (0% by absence, not by failing tests).
Standing one up is Phase F milestone F.7.
